                          <p>We believe in creating an environment where people can be themselves and connect with others around the shared love of Swing music and dance. We believe that people have the right to be able to fully participate and feel safe without judgement. Help us build an amazing and creative event where everyone is welcome.</p>
                            <p>Brisbane Swing Thing acknowledges the Yuggera people and the Turrbal people as the traditional owners of Meanjin, the lands where we live, learn, work and dance. We recognise their cultures, histories and diversity, and their continuing connection to the lands, water and communities. We also pay our deepest respects to Elders, past, present and emerging. We acknowledge the contemporary Queensland Aboriginal community, who have survived invasion and dispossession, and continue to maintain their identity, culture and Indigenous rights.</p>
                            <p>Brisbane Swing Thing acknowledges that we dance historical dance styles that are from a culture that is not our own. When we dance these dances which are rooted in and inspired by the foundations of Jazz music we are guests in the house of Black American culture. We respect and cherish the original Black musicians and dancers who shared their amazing creativity and talent during a time when they were routinely disrespected and mistreated by the society in which they lived.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-center">Code of Conduct</h2>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Respect other people; their bodies, their level in dancing, their backgrounds, their clothes, their personal space. All of it.</li>
                              <li>Pay attention to your partner and the dance floor. We are all sharing space and it’s easy to get caught up in what you are doing. If there is a collision, both parties apologise. If someone has stopped dancing, stop dancing to make sure they are ok.</li>
                              <li>Pay attention to your body. Know your limits and do not exceed them.</li>
                              <li>Don’t do aerials, lifts, or drops on the social dance floor, leave these for jams and competitions. Also, always make sure you have consent from your partner EVERY time before you pull any of these tricks.</li>
                              <li>You can say NO to someone at ANY time for ANY reason. Saying yes to dancers is a good way to help people feel included but you are not obliged to say yes, and if you do say yes you can stop the dance at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Of course this means that no one is obliged to dance with you either, so please be as polite as is practical when you decline, and aim to make every dance you have enjoyable for both you and your partner.</li>
                              <li>Drinking alcohol is fine. Ensure that you do not get intoxicated to the point that you are unaware of any breaches of this code of conduct.</li>
                              <li>Some of our venues are licensed. Please respect this and do not bring your own drinks to these venues.</li>
                              <li>We request that you refrain from wearing strongly scented deodorants or perfumes, as these can trigger allergic reactions or migraines in some people. If possible, please use low-scented or hypoallergenic deodorants. Please apply deodorant before you come to the venue, and if you need to reapply, please do so outside.</li>
                              <li>Harassment & bullying in any form will not be tolerated. If there is an issue you will be warned, asked to leave, banned from our events or the police may be notified as necessary. If you are unsure of what constitutes harassment please visit the Australian Human Rights Commission. Their page on harassment for example is <a href="https://humanrights.gov.au/quick-guide/12040" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

                            <p>If you are injured and require medical attention, fear for your safety, feel threatened or would like to make the organisers aware of inappropriate behaviour, contact a Brisbane Swing Thing team member or representative immediately.</p>
                              <p>If you aren’t sure, if you think something is creepy or it makes you feel uncomfortable and you want a second opinion, please ASK for advice.
